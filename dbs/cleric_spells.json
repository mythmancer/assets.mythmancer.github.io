The aerial servant will return to its native plane of existence at the end of the spell's duration, and earlier if the cleric who summoned it is slain, if the cleric releases the creature from its bondage, or if the servant is banished. When summoning an aerial servant, the cleric must be protected by a protection from evil spell or a holy symbol, or must stand within a magic circle. If the summoner does not take these precautions, the aerial servant will not be subject to any sort of control and will immediately attack the one who called it forth.\n\n\n\n\nWhen fetching forth a living subject, the aerial servant always gains the benefit of surprise on its first attack for 4 surprise segments (unless it is detected). When the aerial servant scores a hit, it has successfully grabbed hold of its target and may bring it back to the cleric if the aerial servant is stronger than its victim. To determine the result of this test of strength, both the aerial servant and its victim roll their hit dice (using the proper die type), and the higher number wins.",

As the spell is cast, the character's material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the cleric may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a \u201csilver cord,\u201d an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\n\n\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane.

Exorcism banishes all charms and enchantments, removes curses, and will cast any possessing demon or other creature back into its nearest physical body other than the one being exorcised. The base chance for the cleric to perform a successful exorcism is randomly determined on a d% if the GM has not previously assigned a specific number to represent the relative difficulty of the exorcism. To the base chance is added a modifier of +1/-1 for each level of difference between the cleric's caster level and the level or hit dice of the opposing supernatural force (determined by the GM in the case of supernatural forces with no stated level or HD). The cleric begins the exorcism, rolling a d% for each turn. If the cleric's die roll is equal to or less than the modified chance of success, the exorcism is successful. The process cannot be halted once it has begun, and if the cleric is forced to pause before successfully casting out the supernatural force, the spell will fail.",

Depending upon the nature of the glyph, a successful saving throw will either reduce the damage by one-half or negate the glyph's effects entirely.

No saving throw applies, but a successful attack is required. In addition to restoring lost levels, the spell can affect other sorts of magically-induced debilities.

It is important to note that the spell does not permit speech with animals of monstrous or unnatural nature; communication with a monster such as a cockatrice, for example, is beyond the spell's power.
