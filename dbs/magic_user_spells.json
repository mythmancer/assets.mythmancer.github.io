The astral plane is a nexus with \nother planes of existence beyond, and the caster may choose to enter \nthese other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the \nastral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in\n that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in \nstasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to \nother locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed \nin a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. \nWhile travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical \nmanifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character \nremains connected to his or her original body by a \u201csilver cord,\u201d an \ninvisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some \nthreats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character \ndies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\n\n\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane. \nUnless an item's magical qualities are imbued so deeply as to exist in \nmany planes, an astral traveller's physical manifestation on another \nplane will be equipped with only the unenchanted substance of otherwise \nmagic items and weapons.",

The spell can create\n any type of sound, but the maximum volume of the noise depends upon the\n caster's level.

If\n the caster teleports both from and into an area which is affected by an\n area-of-effect spell, he will suffer its effects.

When the magic user\n casts the spell, a bead of light streaks from his or her pointed finger\n to the target area, and if it strikes another object directly in its \npath the fireball will detonate immediately. The blast fills the entire \nvolume of the spell radius, and if it is cast into an enclosed area \nsmaller than the area of effect the flames will expand from this area \nuntil the spell's full volume has been reached.

These \nstrands are identical to those created by the web spell, except that \nthey regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the \nguards and wards spell lasts.\n\n\n\n\nConfusion: Where there are choices in direction\u2013such as\n a corridor intersection or side passage\u2013a minor confusion-type effect \nfunctions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are \ngoing in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This \nis an enchantment/charm effect that will not affect elves or other \ncreatures immune to charm.\n\n\n\n\nLost Doors:   One door per caster level is covered by an illusion to appear as if it were a plain wall.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the magic user can place his or her choice of one of the following five magical effects:\n\n\n\n\nDancing lights in four corridors.\n\nA magic mouth in two places.\n\nA stinking cloud in two places. The vapours return within 10 turns if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts.\n\nA gust of wind in one corridor or room.\n\nA suggestion in one place. \nThe caster selects an area of up to 5-ft square, and any creature who \nenters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole warded area radiates strong magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.",

The spell may be used to grant minor wishes (undoing \ncurses, granting small quantities of gold, duplicating the effects of \nlower level spells, etc.) The effects of the spell will be permanent for\n most minor requests, particularly when used to duplicate a lower-level \nspell that has a permanent or instantaneous duration.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a limited wish is not powerful enough to make major \nchanges in reality. It cannot bring the dead back to life, grant a \nlevel, or permanently change ability scores. In many cases, the GM will \nbe called upon to determine whether the caster's wish is within the \npower of a limited wish spell or whether the results of the request will\n suffer from flaws due to the spell's limitations. Flaws would include \nlimited durations or partial results. The guidelines set forth above \nshould give the GM some assistance in making such determinations.\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of unreasonable wishes, the GM may decide to follow the \nwording of the spell precisely but pervert the intent, limit the \nduration of the spell to a very limited time (perhaps mere seconds!) or \nsimply rule that the whole spell fails.\n\n\n\n\nThe guideline here is that wishes are granted by someone or something, \nwhich may or may not be kindly disposed to the player characters. The \nmore greedy or selfish a wish, the greater the chance that a mischievous\n or actually evil power will take the opportunity to teach this upstart \nmortal a lesson.",

To accomplish the transfer of souls, the \nmagic user must trap his or her own life essence within the jar prior to\n the transfer. If the transfer fails (e.g., if the targeted creature \nmakes a successful saving throw), the caster's soul is trapped until it \ncan take over a host or otherwise escape.\n\n\n\n\nThe caster can make successive attempts to take over the same host, but \nno more than one per round. The spell's range applies to two matters; \nwhen the magic user first transfers his or her own life essence into the\n jar, his or her body must be within the spell's range of the jar. The \nrange also limits the distance at which the magic user's soul may later \nescape from the jar and into another body. After the caster's soul moves\n into the jar, his or her physical body becomes inert and lifeless.\n\n\n\n\nThe spell represents, in many ways, a contest of will between the magic \nuser and the creature whose body he or she seeks to possess. The caster \nand the target creature each total their intelligence and wisdom scores \n(such being calculated or approximated by the GM for a monster). This \ncombined score represents the character's mental power for purposes of \nthe spell. The two numbers are compared, and the difference is used in \ntwo important calculations: the saving throw and the chance for escape. \nOne third of the difference (rounded down) is the modifier on the saving\n throw, a bonus if the target creature has the higher mental power, a \npenalty if the magic user's mental power is higher.\n\n\n\n\nIf a creature's soul is trapped in the magic jar by the caster, it has a\n chance to escape. If it escapes, the caster's soul is returned to the \nmagic jar. If the difference in mental power between the caster and the \npossessed creature is 4 or less in favour of the caster, or is in favour\n of the possessed creature, the creature can attempt a new saving throw \nevery round. If the difference is from 5 to 8 in the caster's favour, \none saving throw is permitted per turn. If the difference is 9 to 12 in \nthe caster's favour, the saving throw is made once per day, and if the \ncaster's mental power exceeds that of the target creature by 13+, the \nsaving throw can only be made once per week.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the caster is in the magic jar waiting to possess another body, he\n or she can sense creatures beyond the jar, but not their nature. The \njar may be moved from its original location, but not, obviously, by the \ncaster. When the caster possesses another body, he or she gains complete\n control of its movement and acquires any memories that the body might \nreflexively recall (how to fly, fight with claws, use innate magical \npowers, etc). He or she does not gain any knowledge from the creature's \nmind, such as languages known or the location of a lair, for the mind is\n trapped in the magic jar. The caster retains his or her own mind while \npossessing the other body, so if the body possesses the correct physical\n attributes the caster can continue to cast his or her spells from \nwithin the new body.",
