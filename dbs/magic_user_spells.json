As the spell is cast, the character's material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the caster may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a \"silver cord,\" an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.</br></br>Most magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane.

The focal point can be moved by the caster at will until the spell's duration expires. The spell can create any type of sound, but the maximum volume of the noise depends upon the caster's level. A third level caster can produce the noise of 4 people shouting (or acting more quietly). Each additional caster level allows the caster to add the sound of four more people into the illusion. As a benchmark, the sound of an explosion or landslide would require a caster level of approximately 8th. Listeners are only entitled to saving throws if they have cause to doubt the apparent sounds.

For the duration of the spell, the magic user teleports 2-ft in a random direction once per round. The segment in which the magic user disappears and reappears is determined on 2d4, while the compass direction is rolled on a d8. If the direction roll would result in the caster being teleported into a solid object, the caster will blink a second time, for a distance of no more than 10-ft. If this second blink also results in the caster occupying a solid object, the spell will end, marooning the caster in the æthereal plane of existence. During and after the segment in which the teleportation occurs, the magic user's sudden change of location prevents any direct attacks upon him or her. The caster may only be attacked directly if the attack is made before the blink takes place. If the caster teleports both from and into an area which is affected by an area-of-effect spell, he will suffer its effects. The constant changes of location take a toll upon the caster, who has a 25% chance of failing at attempts to cast spells, use most magic items, or take any action beyond making physical attacks.",

In order to cast the spell, the caster must know the fiend's true name, but such information is often contained in forbidden tomes of lost lore. The spell cannot summon the lesser sorts of demons that have no personal names, nor is it powerful enough to summon members of the demonic or diabolical nobility. The spell provides no protection whatsoever against the wrath of the summoned creature–and make no mistake, the summoned creature will be extremely resentful of the caster's temerity.</br></br>In general, this spell is cast only with multiple protections against the summoned fiend, such as a pentacle to contain the demon and a magic circle to protect the magic user. The exact nature of any discussions or negotiations with creatures of the nether planes is, of course, a matter to be handled in the course of the game, with the GM deciding what the fiend is thinking and how it acts.</br></br>It is treacherous in the extreme to deal with demons, for they are intelligent and ruthless. They are not, however, unreliable; since the caster knows the fiend's true name, it is compelled to abide by any agreements it might make, although it might be able to twist the spirit of the agreement while still abiding to the letter of it.</br></br>Certain spells (spirit-rack or trap the soul, for example) can be (and often are) used to strengthen the magic user's hand in any negotiations with a demon.",

No other spells may be cast during this period of time, nor can the magic user engage in any other meaningful work. When the final words of the spell are spoken, the item makes a saving throw against spells at the same level as the magic user, but with success on the saving throw indicating that the spell has succeeded.

  "Find Familiar": {

    "Details": "Magic users of higher level often summon familiars to assist them with various tasks. Indeed, a familiar can also be of considerable benefit to a lower level magic user (even increasing others' estimation of his or her power), but the risks inherent in losing a familiar can be daunting to a weaker spell caster. To summon a familiar, the magic user must intone the words of the spell over a stocked fire source, sprinkling the flames with expensive incense and powders (100 gp in total value). The caster must maintain his or her casting for as long as necessary (2d12 hours) until a familiar arrives (or the casting time expires without success). The spell may be attempted only once per year, and the caster has no control over the type of animal that will respond. When it arrives, the familiar is a faithful servant and ally to the caster. Normal familiars have 1d3+1 hit points, are AC 7, and are as intelligent as a lower-than-average human. When the familiar is within 120-ft of the magic user, the magic user gains additional hit points equal to the familiar's. However, if the familiar is ever killed, the magic user permanently loses twice the familiar's hit points.</br></br> Caster Level  Familiar </br></br> 1-2  3-5  6-8  9-11  12-14  15+ </br></br>  01-05    01-05    01-06    01-06    01-07    01-07    Special  </br></br>  06-25    06-25    07-29    07-29    08-33    08-33    Cat  </br></br>  26-35    26-36    30-40    30-41    34-45    34-46    Hawk  </br></br>  36-45    37-47    41-51    42-53    46-57    47-59    Owl  </br></br>  46-55    48-58    52-62    54-65    58-69    60-72    Raven  </br></br>  56-65    59-69    63-73    66-77    70-81    73-85    Toad  </br></br>  66-75    70-80    74-84    78-89    82-93    86-98    Weasel  </br></br>  76-00    81-00    85-00    90-00    94-00    99-00    None  </br></br>A special familiar is entitled to a saving throw in order to avoid the effect of the spell.

Creatures making successful saving throws suffer only half the indicated damage. When the magic user casts the spell, a bead of light streaks from his or her pointed finger to the target area, and if it strikes another object directly in its path the fireball will detonate immediately. The blast fills the entire volume of the spell radius, and if it is cast into an enclosed area smaller than the area of effect the flames will expand from this area until the spell's full volume has been reached. The volume of a 20-ft radius sphere is approximately 33,500 cubic-ft, and there are 1,000 cubic-ft in a 10-ft×10-ft×10-ft area, so in an area with a 10-ft ceiling the fireball will fill approximately thirty-three 10-ft×10-ft squares. Thus, if a fireball explodes in the middle of a corridor 10-ft wide and 10-ft high, the blast will extend a staggering 165-ft in both directions. It is quite possible, particularly in dungeoneering environments, for the magic user to be caught in the backblast of his or her own fireball spell. The flames do not create any significant change in air pressure, but the furnace-like heat causes all items in the blast to make saving throws against magical fire or ignite (or, in the case of metals, melt).",

By combining expensive material components with the spell, the caster can make it more likely that the gold will seem true–conversely, there are mundane methods that give a chance to detect this very spell, such as striking the \"gold\" with cold iron (10% chance of changing the metal back).

The caster and the target creature each total their intelligence and wisdom scores (such being calculated or approximated by the GM for a monster). This combined score represents the character's mental power for purposes of the spell. The two numbers are compared, and the difference is used in two important calculations: the saving throw and the chance for escape. One third of the difference (rounded down) is the modifier on the saving throw, a bonus if the target creature has the higher mental power, a penalty if the magic user's mental power is higher.</br></br>If a creature's soul is trapped in the magic jar by the caster, it has a chance to escape. If it escapes, the caster's soul is returned to the magic jar. If the difference in mental power between the caster and the possessed creature is 4 or less in favour of the caster, or is in favour of the possessed creature, the creature can attempt a new saving throw every round. If the difference is from 5 to 8 in the caster's favour, one saving throw is permitted per turn. If the difference is 9 to 12 in the caster's favour, the saving throw is made once per day, and if the caster's mental power exceeds that of the target creature by 13+, the saving throw can only be made once per week.</br></br>While the caster is in the magic jar waiting to possess another body, he or she can sense creatures beyond the jar, but not their nature. The jar may be moved from its original location, but not, obviously, by the caster. When the caster possesses another body, he or she gains complete control of its movement and acquires any memories that the body might reflexively recall (how to fly, fight with claws, use innate magical powers, etc). He or she does not gain any knowledge from the creature's mind, such as languages known or the location of a lair, for the mind is trapped in the magic jar. The caster retains his or her own mind while possessing the other body, so if the body possesses the correct physical attributes the caster can continue to cast his or her spells from within the new body.",

The amount of reduction is increased by 1%/caster level (to be rounded off in the case of lower-level magic users simply as a matter of convenience). Thus, if an orc is struck with the ray by a level one magic user, the orc would lose 26% (rounded to 25%, at the option of the GM) of its strength. Its \"to hit\" rolls are not affected, but any damage it inflicts is reduced to 75% (or 74%) of the damage rolled (a good GM avoids minuscule calculations that might bog down the game). A ray of enfeeblement may technically reduce the target's strength below the required minimum to qualify for a class, but its effects are too temporary to affect class choices (so an enfeebled paladin with a temporary strength of 8 retains his or her paladinhood).

Magically sleeping creatures may be killed or tied up at a rate of one per round by a single person, or can be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit for maximum damage, if the attacker chooses not to kill or bind them. A sleeping creature requires a full round to waken and must be shaken or slapped to bring it to consciousness; mere noise, however loud, will not disturb the enchanted slumber of a sleep spell's victim. The number of enemies affected by the spell is a function of their hit dice. If there are creatures of different hit dice in the area, the weaker ones will be affected first.

    "Type": "Arcane Abjuration",
    "Details": "This spell is used to utterly banish a particular demon, devil, or the like to its home plane of existence for a number of years equal to the caster's level. To cast the spell, the magic user must know the fiendish creature's name, and inscribe it into a scroll, the preparation of which requires 8d6 hours and the expenditure of at least 5,000 gp. Once the spell is cast, if the scroll is read aloud by the caster in the fiend's presence it will have the effects described below. A caster can create no more than one scroll for any particular fiend and can only keep three such scrolls in existence at any one time; the magic of one will fade if a fourth is created.</br></br>When the caster speaks the first words of the scroll in the fiend's presence, the demon is immediately held in place (unless its innate magic resistance allows it to escape this effect). Even if the fiend's magic resistance protects it, the words of the scroll cause considerable agony, and if the creature has the ability to escape it is only 10% likely to remain and try to stop the final reading (0% likelihood if it has no means of attacking the magic user, gaining possession of the scroll, or otherwise influencing events in its favour). After one full minute of reading the scroll (i.e., in the second round), the fiend loses 1 hp/ hit die from pain. In the third round, the fiend loses 50% of its remaining hit points from the agony caused by the words of the scroll. After the third round of reading, the fiend is banished to its home plane, where it writhes in agony for a period of years equal to the caster's level.</br></br>Obviously, any fiend caught with this ritual will seek to negotiate its way out; the GM will determine probabilities based on the fiend's goals and personality, but the base likelihood will be roughly 25% per round that the fiend will agree to perform a task for the caster in exchange for nothing more than the cessation of the ritual.",

The ensorcelled creature can shift in and out of the statue form in one second and is not limited to one such shift in a single round. During the initial transformation, the creature must make a special system shock roll with a flat 82% chance of success, with a +1 for every point of constitution the creature possesses (100% chance at Con 18). Failing this roll means that the creature dies. The statue does radiate magic slightly and can be detected in this manner as well as with other similar divination spells or items. The initial transformation requires a full round.

No creature will leap off a cliff for no reason; but the caster might need to scout the bottom of a chasm and promise to cast a feather fall spell, or hand the victim a \"magical\" torch that supposedly permits the power of flight.

Each round during this period they act randomly, not acting at all (25%), or walking away from the symbol (75%), even if this means breaking off from combat. Such creatures will submit to any demand made by an enemy or ally, including a command to surrender.</br></br>Symbol of Insanity: Creatures with total hit points of not more than 120 are affected by lunacy, acting per the random actions described in the confusion spell. The effect is permanent (or until removed by magical means).</br></br>Symbol of Pain: Any creature triggering the symbol is subjected to horrible pain, losing 2 points of dexterity and gaining a penalty of -4 on all \"to hit\" rolls for a period of 2d10 turns.</br></br>Symbol of Sleep: This symbol causes any creature of 8+1 HD or less to fall into an enchanted slumber; it is impossible to awaken the victims for 4d4+1 turns.</br></br>Symbol of Stunning: Creatures with a total of 160 or fewer hit points are stunned for 3d4 rounds, dropping whatever they are holding.</br></br>Material components for this spell cost at least 10,000 gp.",

Distance off target is 1d10×1d10% of the distance that was to be travelled. The direction off target is determined randomly</br></br>Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that is visually or thematically (depending on how the caster identified it while casting) similar to the target area. It is possible (25% chance) that this result will indicate that the correct location has been reached but that the caster and party will arrive too high, falling 1-ft to 100-ft unless there is means to arrest the fall. If the party arrives too high and the result would entomb them in a solid surface, they die instantly. Generally, the caster will appear in the closest similar place within range.

The wall is utterly unaffected by physical attacks and spells, including dispel magic, and all forms of energy, such as electricity, heat, and cold. The only way actually to destroy a wall of force is with a disintegrate spell. The wall remains in place even if the ground beneath it is destroyed or transformed, hanging magically in place where it was evoked.",

  "Wall of Ice": {
    "Type": "Arcane Evocation",
    "Details": "A wall of ice spell creates a huge wall of ice, with a front face of up to 100 square-ft per level. Its exact dimensions are adjustable by the caster. Thus, if the wall is cast by a 20th level caster, the dimensions of the wall could be any combination of dimensions that multiply to equal 2,000 square-ft. The wall might be 10-ft high and 200-ft long, or 5-ft high and 400-ft long, or 20-ft high and 100-ft long, etc. The wall need not be cast so that it is attached to anything, and it can even be cast in the air to fall upon opponents, doing 3d10 points of damage in the area where it falls. Breaking through the ice with a melee weapon causes 2 hit points of damage from ice shards per inch of thickness, and can be broken out at a rate of 10-ft per round. Normal fire has no measurable effect upon the wall, but magical fire will melt through it in one round. If the wall is destroyed by fire in a single round, it will cause a massive cloud of water vapour to form and linger for a full turn, obscuring vision by 50%.",

In order for the spell to succeed, there must be existing rock large enough to serve as the anchor on each side of the wall. No rock from the foundation is consumed; the wall's stone is created from nothing, but needs existing rock from which to emerge and with which to meld. The wall itself is one quarter of an inch thick for each level of the magic user and has an area of 20-ft×20-ft per caster level. The wall need not be vertical, but must be anchored–a bridge is a good example of a way to create and use a horizontal wall of stone.

Any creature in the area must make a saving throw at a penalty of -2. The effect of a successful saving throw depends upon how close the target is to the edge of the area of effect; if the creature is within five ft of the edge of the spell's area of effect, the creature has jumped free and is not affected by the web. If the creature is not within five ft of the edge and makes its save, that creature will be able to fight its way through the web at twice normal speed (at a rate of 1-ft per turn if its strength is less than 13) and will have no chance of suffocating. No creature within the area of effect, whether a saving throw is made or not, can cast spells or attack. Any creature that fails its saving throw has a cumulative 5% chance of suffocating per turn. Creatures with a strength of less than 13 that fail the saving throw are trapped within the web and cannot move or act at all. Creatures with a strength of 13-17 are capable of moving through 1-ft of webs per turn. A creature with strength 18+ can move through the web at a rate of 10-ft per turn, and creatures such as dragons virtually ignore the webs, breaking through at a rate of 100-ft per turn. The strands of a web spell are very flammable. If they are ignited, fire will flash through the entire web, dealing 2d4 points of damage to all creatures within and burning away the webs.",

The eye travels at a rate of 30-ft per round if it is not scrutinising its surroundings closely, but can proceed no faster than 10-ft per round if it is examining floors, ceilings, and walls. The magic user can detect secret doors through the eye as per his or her normal chance, but cannot view through the eye with any special vision the magic user has, for the eye's vision is limited to its own sensory capabilities.

In order to succeed in this task, the caster must make a saving throw vs spells, with a modifier determined by the difficulty of the spell being transcribed. If the spell is up to one level higher than the magic user can cast, the saving throw is made at +2. If the spell is two levels higher than the magic user can cast, there is no bonus or penalty to the saving throw. If the spell is more than 2 levels higher than the magic user can cast, each additional level adds a -1 penalty. If the magic user fails this saving throw, the spell is not successfully copied, the caster takes 1d4 points of damage for each level of the spell, and he or she is knocked unconscious for 1 turn per hit point sustained thereby. The damage sustained cannot be healed more quickly than 4 hp per day, even with the assistance of magical healing. If the saving throw is successful, the magic user may copy the spell, which takes one hour per level of the spell. The material component is ink costing at least 200 gp. ",
